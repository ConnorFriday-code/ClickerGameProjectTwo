# Clicker Game

## UX

### Project Goal

The purpose of the 'Clicker Game' is to be a single page website hosting a simple game. The game is 'endless' but you lose when the timer runs out, with the timer resetting everytime the user 'clicks' on the a target. When a game over scene happenes, a message will appear announcing it and provides the user with their score. The user earns score by clicking on the target. It needs to have a large amount of interactivity.
