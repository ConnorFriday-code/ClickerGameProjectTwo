# Clicker Game

## UX

### Project Goal

The purpose of the 'Clicker Game' is to be a single page website hosting a simple game. The game is 'endless' but you lose when the timer runs out, with the timer resetting everytime the user 'clicks' on the a target. When a game over scene happenes, a message will appear announcing it and provides the user with their score. The user earns score by clicking on the target. It needs to have a large amount of interactivity.

#### Bare minimum

The features that are needed for a minimum viable product.

* The game needs to load

* The instructions need to load

* The game needs to work as intended without any major bugs

* The game needs to give and track score

* The game needs to reset the score after a game over

* The timer needs to work and end the game when it runs out

* The game needs to present final score at the game over

#### Additional features

Features that can be added if time is available

* Timer can be fancy graphics

* The target will move after every click

* A sound effect (possibly an api) will play on every target click

* Possible upgrades, spending score to earn more score

### User goals

#### First time users

* To be able to quickly understand how to play the game

* To be able to start playing the game with no confusion/hassle

* For the game to run smoothly

#### Returning user

* To be able to quickly get into a game

* For the score to be obvious and easy to read to compare attempts

### Design choices

#### Colours

Components with a bold and bright yellow colour are items I wish the user focuses on. As such, it's a bright and contrasting colour compared to the rest of the page, with the yellow meant to invoke feelings of excitment or joy. Text on yellow backgrounds will remain black to keep readability. The mute blue and grey backgrounds for the game/text area is to prevent eye strain and as to not distract the user while they're clicking on the target. Text will remain black for now, with possible tweaking required if the contrast is not strong enough, likely to the background shade of grey.

The scoreboard will remain plain white. This is due to two reasons: I want the user to focus on it, but not over use yellow. From planning wireframe, the current design is already approaching the limit on how much yellow can be used before it no-longer grabs the user's attention and instead becomes obnoxious. As such, I have chosen for it to be a colourless white to help break up the page while still being eye grabbing.

The timer bar is a mixture of green and red. This is due to the simple colour theory of green being good and red being bad and the emotions they produce. As the timer goes down, the red grows alongside the emotions it envokes. With every click, the timer is reset and green fills the bar, once again bringing its positive emotions. This is to subtly reward/hint the player on want they're meant to do even if they have not read the instructions.

The div that covers the screen on document load is there to explain how to play, as such it uses to bright yellow colours (the title and start button) to create excitement, with the dull colours around them to only strengthen their effects.

The game over message being red follows the previous parapgraph's logic of symbolising a negative thing, in this case losing the game. However, it is promptly followed by the score being a bright yellow to bring back some joy and excitement.

Social media icons are yellow to create an arua of positivity, as we want users to click on them. The play again button is yellow to create excitement and persuade the user to try again and see if they can beat their prevous score.
